* Executive Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ExecutiveSummary
:END:

This document details the secuirty assessment ~(external pentration testing)~ of =VulnHub | DarkHole2.= The purpose of the assessment waw to provide a review of the security posture of =VulnHub | darkHole2= Internet infrastructure, as well, as to identify potential weaknesses in its Internet infrastructure.

** Scope of Work
This security assessment covers the remote penetration testing of one accessible server hosted on =192.168.0.11= addresses. The assessment was carried out from a black box perspective, with the only supplied infromation being the tested servers' IP addresses. No other infromation was assumed at the start of the assessment.

** Project Objectives
This security assessment is carried out to gauge the security posture of =VulnHub | arkHole2= Internet facing hosts. The result of the assessment is then analyzed for vulnerabilities. Given the limited time that is givern to perform the assessment, only immediately exploitable services have been tested. The vulnerabilities are assigned a risk rating based on threat, vulnerability, and impact.

** Assumption
While writing the report, we assume that both IP addresses are considered to be public IP addreass, NDA and rules of engagement have been signed, and based on the information gathering phase the company name is ~VunlHUB~

** Timeline
The timeline of the test is as below:

| Penetration Testing | Start Date/time | End Date/time |
| Pen Test 1          | mm/dd/yyyy      | mm/dd/yyyy    |

* Methodology

:CUSTOM_ID: Methodology

** Planning
During planning, we gather information from public sources to learn about the target:
- Technical infrastructure
  Then, we datect the live system and its O.S and determine the running services and its.

** Reporting
Based on the results from the first step, we start analyzing the results. *Our Risk* rating is based on this calculation.
